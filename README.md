Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

* yarn start

Starts the development server so you can open your app in the Expo app on your phone.

* yarn run ios (Mac only, requires Xcode)

Starts the development server and loads your app in an iOS simulator.

* yarn run android (Requires Android build tools)

Starts the development server and loads your app on a connected Android device or emulator.

* yarn test

Starts the test runner.

* yarn run eject

Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

```shell
cd MinaOTP-Native
yarn start
```

Happy hacking!
